# Continuous_multivariate_methods
These data are about University of Texas National Scholarship Eligibility Test scores for a set of twins, scores shown separately for each individual. (That is, for example, for the English course, we have two columns related to the score of the English language test, each of which is for one person.)
<br> NOTE: More details about the variables are available in the report file.
<br> Because this data is multivariate and continuous, we must use continuous multivariate methods to analyze and model it. In this project, we applied the following to the data:
<br> 1) Multivariate regression
<br> 2) PCA
<br> 3) CCA
<br> 4) FACTOR ANALYSIS
<br> 5) LDA
